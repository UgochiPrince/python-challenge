    # PyPoll - This script generally imports the csv file, goes through the file path and reads it; then extracts the following information:
        # The total number of votes cast
        # A complete list of candidates who received votes
        # The percentage of votes each candidate won
        # The total number of votes each candidate won
        # The winner of the election based on popular vote.
        It also ensure a text file is created and the result of the election analysis is exported to it while also being printed on the terminal. This process should make the voting analysis process a lot easier and faster.

        # The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
        # The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
        # The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
        It also ensure a text file is created and the result of the budget analysis is exported to it while also being printed on the terminal.
